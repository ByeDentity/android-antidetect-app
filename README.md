### ABOUT THE APP

üì± ByeDentity is an anti-detect app for Android that allows your device to change multiple parameters within your system to create a unique fingerprint.
Unlike any other tools, this app forces your phone to change all the data at the system level ‚Äî not just within specific apps.
It also operates in stealth mode, making it completely invisible to apps and services.
